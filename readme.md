binutils is a growing collection of helper scripts for making life easier.
Most of these are written in Python, with some written in bash. Pull requests 
are welcome.

Target environment is OS X, but these scripts should work on any *NIX. Enjoy!

## Installation

Clone the repo and add the directory to your path. I use ~/.bash_profile for this.

To set up the virtualenv for python commands, run `pyenv virtualenv 3.9.7 venv.binutils`

## Commands

Run `binutils` to see a list of commands. Run a command with no arguments to see usage.
